# Keylogger

This is a project I did as part of a case study course in cyber defense in the third year.
The Keylogger was written in Python in the pycharm work environment.

## Project description:

### `This keylogger has the following options:`

1. Capture data on mouse movement, clicks and more.
2. Capturing keys on the keyboard, passwords and more. Including saving the copy-paste and the location in Windows.
3. Saving screenshots.
4. The Keylogger works in a way that is not visible to the user.
5. The information captured by the Keylogger will be sent to the email of the "hacker".
6. The Keylogger is automatically restarted during a restart or when the computer is turned on.

In addition to the project, this course included a presentation in front of the class about the project subject.
This is the presentation I made:
